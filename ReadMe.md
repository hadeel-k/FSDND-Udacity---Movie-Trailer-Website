# Movie Trailer Website Project

# Description
These are the files required to run one of Udacity's projects called "Movie Trailer Website" using Python.

# About This Project
This project is for Udacity's Full Stack Developer Nanodegree Program. The created website shows a list of my favorite movies with a trailer for each movie. 

# Guidelines on How to Open the Website
* You need to install **Python 3.7** 
* Using Python, you need to run: **entertainment_center.py**
(Otherwise you can just download the repository to you PC and open **fresh_tomatoes.html**)

Click on each movie poster and the trailer will pop-up for you.
Enjoy!
